I wonder if the power of the open source community can be used for something other than software. Can it be harnessed to write a novel?

This repo contains this readme and the novel contents. Below is a synopsis of how I see the story unfolding, but this is just the minimum viable product. The story is subject to change, and I hope it does.

Let's see if we can make a novel!

Synopsis
--------

A bright teenager named William witnesses a drug deal that goes horribly wrong. One of the people involved looks horribly out of place and is fatally wounded. The teenager attempts to help this stranger but with his dying breath the stranger gives the teen a smartphone and tells him he needs to deliver it to man named Percival.

William gets home and explores the phone and begins to find a way of locating the mysterious Percival. Mysterious men attempt to abduct William and the police are after him as well.

William encounters a young woman named Tina. Tina tells William of a secret cult of renowned physicists who have proven the existence of Whitchcraft and a splinter group using quantum physics to manipulate it down a dark and destructive path.
