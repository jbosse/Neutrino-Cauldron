The Neutrino Cauldron
=====================

Chapter One
-----------

William was jolted awake by the clamor of the final bell. He always had trouble staying awake in American History, and today was no exception. Even though William was an exceptionally bright student with a 4.0 grade point average, it was getting harder for him to manage a full-time job working the night shift, getting his kid brother to school, and staying awake in the most boring class in his almost four years of high school.

"William, can you please stay a moment," droned Mr. Selig. William suddenly got a sinking feeling his little cat nap hadn't gone unnoticed.

"I got a call today from my buddy in the admissions office at MIT today and he's going to be here this weekend for a conference and said he'd like to meet you." Mr. Selig was really pushing William into applying but there was no way he could leave his little brother here in L.A. eren if he could afford to go to college. On the bright side, Mr. Selig wasn't upset about his sleeping in class.

"I told you Boston is too cold," he replied half-hearted.

"Please let me take you both to lunch so you can hear what he has to say."

"Alright," was what he said but, "just drop this pipe dream already," was what he was thinking as he slung his backpack over his shoulder and walked out of the class.

"Oh, and William, please try and stay awake in class tomorrow."

It felt like a smack in the back of the head. He hated to disappoint his favorite teacher but its impossible to burn the candle at both ends and stay awake for American History.
